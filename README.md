## Game Off 2023
The theme was "Scale", so I decided to take an idea for a dungeon crawler I had and add moments of "Scale" by using a camera to zoom in and out to give the player a sense of scale to their environment.
I also applied a "Scale" to the monsters, where you have large swarms of enemies (Each time you encounter a swarm it should be a big larger then the last) and then topping it off with a pnysically larger boss monster.


## Notes
- Use whatever elements of this project as you can, this was my first project in Godot and the code is not ideal in some areas but due to time constraints it is what it is :)
